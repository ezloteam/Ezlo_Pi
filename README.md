# ezlopi
EzloPi is an open-source project contributed by Ezlo Innovation to extend the capabilities of ESP32/ESP32-C3 chipset-based devices and platforms. It provides unparalleled capabilities to configure and control your ESP-based devices and bring any of your automation ideas to life. In the first release we are starting with configuring and controlling of GPIOs and each next release will add more and more functionality.
