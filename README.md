# 1. Getting started
EzloPi features a [web-based configurator](https://config.ezlopi.com/) that allows you to easily configure your ESP32 device for various supported features. The web interface provides a user-friendly platform to set up relays, analog inputs, digital inputs, and I2C-based sensors on your ESP32 device with ease. Once configured, you can leverage our cloud and mobile app services to remotely control your device in real-time.

# 2. Customizing and building EzloPi firmware in your local setup
It is required to have [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) installed in your machine.
Install ESP-IDF with taking help from the docs [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.4.4/esp32/). ESP-IDF version [v4.4.4-292-g7894f032f6-dirty](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/releases/tag/v4.4.4).

### 1. Clone the Ezlo-Pi Repository from GitHub

Navigate to your terminal or bash shell and execute the following commands:

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:ezloteam/Ezlo_Pi.git ezlopi
cd ezlopi/firmware/ezlopi
```

### 2. Build the Project

Execute the following command to build the project:

```bash
idf.py build
```

### 3. Flash the Firmware

To flash the firmware, use the following command:

```bash
idf.py -p <COM Port Name> -b <baud> flash
```

### 4. Open Serial Monitor

To open the serial monitor, use the following command:

```bash
idf.py -p <COM Port Name> monitor
```

Replace `<COM Port Name>` with the appropriate port name and `<baud>` with the desired baud rate.
